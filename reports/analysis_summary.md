# Onboarding Workflow Analysis Summary

## Dataset scope
- Reconstructed onboarding events: 43
- Anonymized artifact inventory rows: 27
- Failure taxonomy entries: 12
- Knowledge-transfer gap entries: 15

## Key signals
- Most frequent risk tag: **domain_switching** (4 occurrences).
- Most frequent domain: **D&D delivery training** (2 events).
- Most frequent role mode: **learner_analyst** (5 events).

## Interpretation

The reconstructed data suggests that the onboarding experience was not simply a matter of difficult ERP content.
The stronger pattern is the compression of live project exposure, formal training, artifact fragmentation, manufacturing ERP complexity, data reconciliation, and shifting role expectations into one remote onboarding environment.

From a CWI perspective, the case can be interpreted as a workflow scaffolding failure.
The employee was exposed to many artifacts and domains, but the relationships among learning stage, role boundary, artifact status, feedback loop, and operational responsibility were not sufficiently staged.
